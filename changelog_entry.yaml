- bump: minor
  changes:
    fixed:
    - Set property_purchased stochastically at 3.85% based on HMRC housing transaction data, fixing unrealistic SDLT charges that caused 224% tax rates in the first income decile.
    added:
    - Tests for property_purchased rate and SDLT total validation against official HMRC figures.
    - Tests for low-income decile sanity checks to prevent negative net incomes and impossible tax rates.
