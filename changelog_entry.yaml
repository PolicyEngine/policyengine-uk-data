- bump: patch
  changes:
    fixed:
    - Fix salary sacrifice headcount regression caused by uprating mismatch. The
      calibrator classified records above/below the 2k cap at uprated 2025 prices,
      but the saved dataset stores values at 2023 prices where the classification
      differs. Now evaluates SS amounts at base-year prices before applying the
      threshold, so calibration matches what end-users see. Also reduces Stage 2
      imputation target to let the calibrator upweight gently rather than overshoot.
    - Remove xfail markers from salary sacrifice headcount tests.
