- bump: patch
  changes:
    fixed:
    - Fix salary sacrifice headcount regression caused by uprating mismatch. The
      calibrator classified records above/below the 2k cap at uprated 2025 prices,
      but the saved dataset stores values at 2023 prices where the classification
      differs. Now evaluates SS amounts at base-year prices before applying the
      threshold, so calibration matches what end-users see. Stage 2 imputation now
      moves the full employee pension amount to SS (instead of capping at 2k) so
      both above-cap and below-cap records are created for the calibrator.
    - Remove xfail markers from salary sacrifice headcount tests.
