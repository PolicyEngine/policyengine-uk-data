# PolicyEngine UK Data

PolicyEngine's project to build accurate UK household survey data.

## Local dataset builds

For a full local dataset build:

1. Ensure the private prerequisite folders exist under `policyengine_uk_data/storage/`.
2. Use Python 3.13. Python 3.14 currently fails while loading PyTables/Blosc2 in this repo.
3. Prefer the sibling `policyengine-uk` checkout when building locally, because the published wheel in your active environment may not expose all variables required by the data pipeline.

If `../policyengine-uk` exists, you can run:

```sh
make data-local
```
